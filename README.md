# SE_Day1
Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

# Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software enineering is a systematic application of engineering principles in designing, developing, testing and and maintanining of software products that are of high and renowned as well as acceptable high quality. Software engineering is critical in the evolution of the world and always has had yhe ability to usher in a new world order where manual tasks are done efficiently, effectively in short period of time.


# Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
  Milestone 1
  In 1940s the development of frist digital computer and the intoduction of the term Software engiineering

  Milestone 2
  1960s development of first object oriented programming langues eg Fortran and C
  1960s The establishment of Software engineering as a stand alone  and well recognized discipline

# List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Software developement stages are not cast in stone. Different users companies intergrate or skip some steps. Howver, in general,  software development Cycle has 6 stages which are as below:
 ### Stage 1
 Requirements
 During this stage, software developer gathers customer needs and illicit for customer requirements or business task at hand.This also involves identifying the problem which needs to be solved and documenting all required resource and  system requirements.
 
### Stage 2
 Design
 This the stage where the idea is put into a blueprint. Creating a highlevel, detailed design f the product or software architecture, user interface and also bearing in mind the aspect of user experience.
 
### Stage 3
 Development/ implementation
 At this stage, the designed blueprint or software archtecture is now used to guide the real work. Its the stage where the real job is done and coding starts.
 
### Stage 4
 Testing
 After completing the code and developing the software, the fourth stage is testing and troubleshooting the software. This is a test drive to gauge if the software live up to the expectations, business rules and delivers what it was expected to deliver. Also during this stage, testers troubleshoot for failures, bugs  which would lead to optimization.
 
### Stage 5
 Deployement
 After the software has undergone meticulous testing, observation and inspection, once it passed, the it is ready for deployment. That is it is the released into the market or handed over to the customer to start solving the problem it was designed for.
 
### Stage 6
 Maintanance
 The final stage is introducing updates, and continuously ensure the software runs smoothly and lives at par with new technologies and updated and new enhancements introduces also based on new customer needs or requestes
 

# Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall methodology is sequential, standardized, according to the plan approach to software development whilst agile is incremental in nature. Waterfall follows strict writen down stages abd ones one stage i done then move to the next whilst agile is a bit flexible through utilization of small teams (sprints). Waterfall is like bulding a puzzle where each piece is special and should on fit in its place whilst agile is like building a lego house through focusing on one brick at a time.

# Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer
Is the person responsible for designing and writting the code or creatin a software product


Quality Assurance Engineer
The quality assurance Engineer is reposnible for guaranteeing quality through idesignicng and exceuting test plans

Project Manager
Is like the captain of a ship. This is the main actor who brings everything together through having a 360 arial view and making sure the project stays on track, within the budget and delivers  quality product.

# Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDE are critical because they provide comprehensive tools to  software engineers so they can write the code, view the product, test and debug the software. For instnce, VS Code allows coding for website and you can preview the website as you code and troubleshoot for erros and can see the realtime effect of your code.

Vesrion Control Systems are are softwares designed to track changes to the initial source code and also used to facillitate team colloboration. An exmplae for VCS is Git and subversion

# What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
1. Ever changing and developing system requirements
For isntance, Windows 7 was once a beautiful nd well accpted operating system.But with time and new developments, it reached its lifetime where it was nolonger compatible to excute and was discontinued. Discontuing i not always the best soution. So another strategy to overcome is to have a maintanance team which maintains and alays researching and enhancing the and upgrading the software when needed.

3. Tigh deadlines and also ever changing customer needs
   Need for planning properly, creating and assigning different teams responsibilities to stay on track and also be flexible to intergrate new user needs

# Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing is a test which is run aon a specific unit whilst inetrgartation testing is trobleshooting the integration of different doftware components, i.e how it works well withh assigned librarie and databases.
System testing focuses on overal testing of the software product on every component and ensure everything works as a whole and acceptance testing measures or checks how the final product meets the requirements. This test is done to quickly identify defects or mallfunctions and quickly fix them before the software product is deployed.

These tests are important in strengthening quality assurance. As the tests are cinducted, they simulate the real worl use of the software to identify areas of improvemnet, bugs and finally check if the product passes and can graduate to the deployment stage. This lessens chances of the product being returned by the customer after realizing issues that were not identified because there were no tests done.

# Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

# Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is a way of inetracting with Artficial Intelligent ,odels like Chatgpt etc. It gives guidance and direction in terms of strategies and effective ways of interacting with AI modesl and get the best out of the interaction.

# Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Example of a vague promt is  teah me mathematics. the ai will not know which topic are you realy interested in. s a result, it will end up generalizing everything.A better way of asking the same is " Teach me mathematics and focus on algebra. Explain everything like to a newbie. This promt will direct the AI to give you what you need.
