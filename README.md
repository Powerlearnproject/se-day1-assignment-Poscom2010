# SE_Day1
Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

# Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software enineering is a systematic application of engineering principles in designing, developing, testing and and maintanining of software products that are of high and renowned as well as acceptable high quality. Software engineering is critical in the evolution of the world and always has had yhe ability to usher in a new world order where manual tasks are done efficiently, effectively in short period of time.


# Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
  Milestone 1
  In 1940s the development of frist digital computer and the intoduction of the term Software engiineering

  Milestone 2
  1960s development of first object oriented programming langues eg Fortran and C
  1960s The establishment of Software engineering as a stand alone  and well recognized discipline

# List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Software developement stages are not cast in stone. Different users companies intergrate or skip some steps. Howver, in general,  software development Cycle has 6 stages which are as below:
 ### Stage 1
 Requirements
 During this stage, software developer gathers customer needs and illicit for customer requirements or business task at hand.This also involves identifying the problem which needs to be solved and documenting all required resource and  system requirements.
 
### Stage 2
 Design
 This the stage where the idea is put into a blueprint. Creating a highlevel, detailed design f the product or software architecture, user interface and also bearing in mind the aspect of user experience.
 
### Stage 3
 Development/ implementation
 At this stage, the designed blueprint or software archtecture is now used to guide the real work. Its the stage where the real job is done and coding starts.
 
### Stage 4
 Testing
 After completing the code and developing the software, the fourth stage is testing and troubleshooting the software. This is a test drive to gauge if the software live up to the expectations, business rules and delivers what it was expected to deliver. Also during this stage, testers troubleshoot for failures, bugs  which would lead to optimization.
 
### Stage 5
 Deployement
 After the software has undergone meticulous testing, observation and inspection, once it passed, the it is ready for deployment. That is it is the released into the market or handed over to the customer to start solving the problem it was designed for.
 
### Stage 6
 Maintanance
 The final stage is introducing updates, and continuously ensure the software runs smoothly and lives at par with new technologies and updated and new enhancements introduces also based on new customer needs or requestes
 

# Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.


# Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.


# Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.


# What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.


# Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


# Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


# Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.


# Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
